# Nebula
## A organization for collaborative and long term projects.
This is based around free, and open source software, for things like modding, and helpful programs for people.

My goal with this to is make a safer space for people, and make modifications for software easier.

### For a safer, more open online experience.

Our Goals:

## Software freedom.
We believe that when you buy software, it should be entirely within your rights to modify it, as long as it doesn't negatively affect other users.

## Safer online experience
We believe that people should feel safe online, without worry about being tracked. In the end, we hope to make a safter space for people, without ads or tracking.
